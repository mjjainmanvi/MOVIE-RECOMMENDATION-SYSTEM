• Implemented a content-based recommendation approach that
leveraged the movie attributes, including genres, keywords, cast,
and directorinformation.
• Using techniques such as vectorization with bag-of-words, I represented the textual data in a numerical format to capture the
essence of each movie and enable similarity calculations.
• By calculating the cosine similarity scores between the user’s preferred movies and the entire movie database,the system identified
movies with similar content features and generated relevant recommendations.
• To provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface, I utilized
Streamlit, aPython library for building interactiveweb applications.
• I integrated IMDb APIs to retrieve additional movie information
such as posters and overviews.
